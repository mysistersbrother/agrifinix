<a name="usage"><h2>Installation & Usage</h2></a>

<h3>Python</h3>

Download [Python 3.12][python-download-link] and install it.
**IMPORTANT: Make sure to check the option to add python to PATH so you can run it through the terminal.**

<h3>Macro</h3>

1. Download and unzip the ZIP from the [latest release][latest-release-link]
2. Open a terminal in the folder that you unzipped the macro to
3. In the terminal run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

<h4>Macro Setup</h4>

After installing we need to setup the macro so it works properly on your screen size.

1. Run `python setup.py`
2. Resize your roblox window to whatever you prefer and then click Enter in the terminal
3. Begin fishing in the roblox window, when the fishing minigame begins then click Enter in the terminal

A window should now open with instructions at the top, follow them step-by-step to complete the setup.

1. Click in the middle of one of the letters in 'Fish!'

You should now be ready to run the fishing macro. To do so just enter `python autofish.py` and then move your mouse to be in focus of the Roblox window. Make sure it is not in the way of the fishing UI, just put it off to the side somewhere.

In the future you can just run the fishing macro without the setup.
